## Features ##
There are five, count them, five randomly generated mad libs that you, no not you, you! Yes, you can interact with. Just enter the type of word when prompted on the command line and, as if by magic, your words appear within the confines of a short block of text. Spooky!

>*It's a marvel of modern technology! - no-one*

## Nifty tricks ##

- Note the function to convert the string into a template literal, now THAT is podracing.
- Check out the duel function of that variable object, the value is the basis for the user prompt and the key is used in the return object. Good grief!
- I decided to keep it functional so none of the global variables get touched. Pretty neat, huh?

## To be improved ##

- It could probably be turned into a class at some point to keep all those lovely juices on the inside.
- The user input could be cleaned up a bit. Maybe capitalise the names but not the rest etc.

## Any questions ##

Well. the fact that you're on my github profile suggest you know where to find me :sunglasses:

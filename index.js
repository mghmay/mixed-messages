Everyday he went to school hoping no one had discovered the truth. You see ${boyName1}'s parents were really ${vegetable1}s. How he turned out to be a normal boy, he didn't know. It was report card time, the trickiest time of the year, because that was when the teachers usually wanted to meet all of the students' parents. Boy always did his best in school so that his parents wouldn't have to meet his teacher.
  This year was no exception, except that ${teacherName} always wanted to meet everyone's parents. Sure enough, at the bottom of his report card, an interview time had been scheduled. Boy was devastated! How would he explain?
  When he brought his report card home, his parents were excited. Finally they would get to meet one of ${boyName1}'s teachers. That evening ${boyName1} and his parents walked to the school. All the while ${boyName1} was dying inside. How, oh how, would he explain!? Hey, wait a minute! When he looked around he saw ${girlName1}'s name, the most popular girl in class and her parents were ${vegetable2} and walking towards the gym was ${boyName2}e and his parents were ${vegetable3}.
